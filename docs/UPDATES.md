# Recent Infrastructure Updates

## Multi-Application Integration (March 2025)

The infrastructure has been expanded to host a complete suite of network management tools instead of just the Workbook Importer application. The suite now includes:

1. **Workbook Importer** - Import and process network workbooks
2. **Workbook Exporter** - Export network configurations to standardized workbooks
3. **Firewall Request Generator** - Generate properly formatted firewall change requests

### Key Changes

#### User Experience
- Added an attractive landing page with application cards for easy navigation
- Configured URL routing to make each application accessible through intuitive paths:
  - `/importer` - Workbook Importer
  - `/exporter` - Workbook Exporter
  - `/firewall` - Firewall Request Generator
- Created consistent styling and user experience across applications

#### Infrastructure
- Modified Nginx configuration to serve as a reverse proxy for all three applications
- Configured separate services for each application with proper system resources
- Added wkhtmltopdf package for PDF generation in the Firewall Request Generator
- Created systemd services for each application for proper process management
- Enhanced monitoring and diagnostics for all applications

#### Security
- Fixed security group circular dependency using aws_security_group_rule
- Enhanced security by restricting outbound traffic to only necessary services
- Configured AWS provider version constraints
- Enforced IMDSv2 requirement to prevent SSRF attacks
- Added EBS volume encryption for EC2 instances
- Restricted ELB egress rules to only allow HTTP to web instances

### Testing and Validation

The infrastructure includes built-in validation:
- Automated health checks for all applications
- Connectivity testing script for quick diagnostics (`/opt/check_services.sh`)
- Service status monitoring and logging
- Information pages showing instance details

### Next Steps

- Apply security enhancements (`terraform apply`)
- Configure HTTPS with AWS Certificate Manager
- Implement auto-scaling for better resilience
- Add CloudWatch monitoring for all applications
- Set up centralized logging
