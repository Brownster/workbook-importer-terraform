# Infrastructure Review Results

## Overview

A thorough review of the Network Tools Suite infrastructure has been completed with a focus on:
1. Removing direct references to port 5001 in load balancer and security configurations
2. Updating all path references from `/app` to the new structure (`/importer`, `/exporter`, `/firewall`)
3. Ensuring proper proxy configuration through Nginx

## Key Findings and Fixes

### Security Configuration

- **Security Groups**: No external access was permitted to port 5001 already. The security group configuration only allows traffic to ports 80 and 443 from external networks. Internal ports (5001, 5002, 5003) are correctly protected.

- **Comments Update**: The explanatory comments in `security.tf` correctly describe that Flask applications are only accessed internally.

### Documentation Updates

1. **HTTPS Instructions**: Updated application paths in `docs/https_instructions.md` to reflect the new structure:
   - Changed from `https://your-domain.com/app` to the appropriate paths for each application
   - Added references to all three applications

2. **README.md**: 
   - Updated deployment process to reflect all three applications
   - Updated access URLs to show the correct paths for each application

3. **Additional Diagnostics**: 
   - Updated diagnostic script to use new URL paths
   - Improved ELB connectivity tests to check all application endpoints
   - Added port 443 to network listener checks for HTTPS support

### Path Configuration

- All references to the old `/app` path have been removed and replaced with the new path structure using `/importer`, `/exporter`, and `/firewall`.

- The Nginx configuration in `user_data.sh` was already correctly configured to proxy requests to the appropriate internal services based on these paths.

## Health Check Configuration

- The health checks for the load balancer target correctly to port 80.

- Internal application health checks have been integrated into each Flask application using the health_bp Blueprint.

## Monitoring and Diagnostics

- The service check script now includes tests for all three applications.

- Port monitoring has been updated to include port 443 (HTTPS) alongside the internal ports.

## Conclusion

The infrastructure is properly configured to securely serve all three applications through Nginx on ports 80/443. No direct exposure of internal application ports (5001, 5002, 5003) exists, and all documentation and scripts have been updated to reflect the new multi-application structure.

The landing page provides a clean and intuitive way for users to access each application through a consistent interface.

### Recommendations

1. Complete HTTPS setup following the updated instructions
2. Implement the security enhancements from `improvement_plan.md`
3. After deploying, verify all applications are accessible through their respective paths
